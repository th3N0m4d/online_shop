# Fashiop

Fashiop is a basic e-commerce application geared towards clothing products developed by [ColorLib](https://colorlib.com). This project is originally written in pure css with some jquery. 

This is my attempt at upgrading the project by rethinking it with the MERN stack and industry best practices.

```bash
